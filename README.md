# Patients Monitor Platform
http://flask-env.eba-n2ygvpns.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Design of Patients Monitor Platform
- All the funtions' entrances of this platform are shown on the home page, and there the description of the platform is also on the home page.
- Users are able to go to different tables to complete their data through clicking different hyperlinks.
- The design of Patients Monitor Platform is made up of two parts, `Device` part and `Chat` part. Flask is used to implement the functions in this project. `application.py` is the file that composes the two parts into one application, by using flask.

## Design of Device Module
- `Device_Module.py` is the code of building the table of Device messages. There is defalut data in the table, which is created in `table.py`. In device part, five tables have been created: `Users`, `Devices`, `Measurements`, `Assignments`, and `Storage`.   
  - It has the function of checking if the data works.
  ``` Python   
    def check_user_id(self):
        if self.user_id in self.user_id_list:
            self.logger.error("The user id has been recorded.")
        elif not isinstance(self.user_id, int):
            self.logger.error("The format of user id is wrong.")
        else:
            return True

    def check_device_id(self):
        if self.device_id in self.device_id_list:
            self.logger.error("The device id has been recorded.")
        elif not isinstance(self.device_id, int):
            self.logger.error("The format of device id is wrong.")
        else:
            return True   

    def check_role(self):
        roles = ["Patient", "Doctor", "Nurse", "AI_Developer", "Administrator"]
        if self.role not in roles:
            self.logger.error("Your role is not acceptable.")
        else:
            return True
    ```
    - After checking the data, it will add the data into the tables.
    ``` Python
    def create_device(self, dt):
        Users = tuple(list(dt["Users"].values()))
        Devices = tuple(list(dt["Devices"].values()))
        Measurements = tuple(list(dt["Measurements"].values()))
        Assignments = tuple(list(dt["Assignments"].values()))

        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db) # table.db
        cur = conn.cursor()

        sql_statement = 'INSERT INTO Users VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)'
        cur.executemany(sql_statement, [Users])

        sql_statement = 'INSERT INTO Devices VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)'
        cur.executemany(sql_statement, [Devices])

        sql_statement = 'INSERT INTO Measurements VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)'
        cur.executemany(sql_statement, [Measurements])
        
        sql_statement = 'INSERT INTO Assignments VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)'
        cur.executemany(sql_statement, [Assignments])

        cur.execute(f'INSERT INTO Storage VALUES ((SELECT MAX(Premission) + 1 FROM Storage),{self.user_id}, {self.device_id}, "{self.role}")')

        conn.commit()
        conn.close
    ```
- `flask_device` is the code of implementing the function of getting and posting the data of tables. Users are able to get the data through go to the website http://flask-env.eba-unimkryi.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ .
  - Five tables mentioned above are all included in the code.
  ``` Python
  @application.route("/create", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def Storage():
    ...
  
  @application.route("/users", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def Users():
    ....
    
  @application.route("/devices", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def Devices():
	if request.method == "POST":
		new_data = {"Devices":{'Device_id': int(request.form['Device_id']),
					'MAC': request.form['MAC'],
					'Date_of_Purchase': request.form['Date_of_Purchase'],
					'User_id': int(request.form['User_id']),
					'Fir_ver': request.form['Fir_ver']}}

		insert_data("Devices", new_data)

		return new_data
	else:
			data = get_data("Devices", col_devices)
			return render_template("devices.html", data = data)
    
  @application.route("/measurements", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def Measurements():
    ...
  @application.route("/assignments", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def Assignments():
    ...
  ```
## Design of Chat Module
- `Chat_Module.py` is the code of building the table of Chat records. There is defalut data in the table. In chat part, there are two table: `User_UserId_Records` and `User_ConnectID_Records`. 
  - It has the function of checking if the data works.
  ``` Python
	def check(self, user_id, connect_id):
		if (isinstance(user_id, int) and isinstance(connect_id, int)):
			if (user_id != connect_id):
				return True
  ```
   - After checking the data, it will create the tables and add the data into them.
  ``` Python
  def create_tables(self, user_id, connect_id):
    ...
    
  def store_data(self, user_id, connect_id, message_type, content):
    ...
  ```
- `flask_chat` is the code of implementing the function of getting and posting the data of the tables. Users are able to get the data through go to the website http://flask-env.eba-unimkryi.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/ .
  - In the flask chat part, two tables are included into the same page.
  ``` Python
  @application.route("/chat", methods=["POST", "GET"])
  def chat():
    if request.method == "POST":
      user_id = int(request.form['User_id'])
      connect_id = int(request.form['Connect_id'])
      message_type = request.form['Message_Type']
      content = request.form['Content']
      #time = str(datetime.datetime.now())
      if(p.check(user_id, connect_id)):
        p.create_tables(user_id, connect_id)
        p.store_data(user_id, connect_id, message_type, content)
        data = {'Records':p.data_rec, 'Connects':p.data_con}
        return data

      else:
        return "things wrong"
    else:
        data = p.table_rec
        return render_template("chat.html", data = data)
  ```
## Branching Strategy
- In this project, the branches are created based on the features of the project. 
- Each branch fufills the corresponding Github Issue.
- Each branch inculdes the code of implementation and the unit test of it.
- When the branch has completed its tasks, it will be merged to main.
